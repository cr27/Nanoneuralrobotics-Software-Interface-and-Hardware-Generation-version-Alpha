The antenna of the nanobot can be designed to detect and interpret different
amplitudes of electrical and optical signals. By choosing appropriate materials and engineering
the structure of various antenna on the nanobot, it can be made sensitive to specific frequencies and amplitudes
of signals. The nanobot can then use this information to initiate a particular behavior, such as movement or
release of a drug payload.
    1. Move the Nanobot - Amplitude = ~ 0.4
    2. Deliver Chemical/Signal to environment - Amplitude = ~0.6
    3. Manage Power and Energy - Amplitude = ~ 0.5
    4. Nanobot is stuck and needs to be moved with a new signal - Amplitude = ~ 0.7
    5. Action Potential/Neural Signal transformed by nanobot's analog circuitry into electrical or optical signal
    tracking behavior of Neurons - Amplitude = ~0.8
