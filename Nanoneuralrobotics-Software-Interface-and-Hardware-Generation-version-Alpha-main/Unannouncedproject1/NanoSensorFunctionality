The following is a decription of the hypothetical nanoneuralrobot's biohybrid hardware:

Analog nano circuitry to monitor and interpret neural activity

Carbon nanotubes and nanowires nanosensors for detection of ions and action potentials.

Optical nanobiosensor: This sensor would detect changes in light intensity or wavelength and use this information
to control the nanobot's speed or direction of movement.

Mechanical nanobiosensor: This sensor would detect changes in the mechanical properties of the
nanobot's surroundings and provide feedback to the actuator, allowing the nanobot to move or adjust
its position as needed.

Electrochemical nanobiosensor: This sensor would measure the electrical properties of
the nanobot's environment and use this information to regulate the nanobot's power and energy usage.

Chemical nanobiosensor: This sensor would detect specific chemical signals in the environment and trigger the
release of a chemical payload from the nanobot, allowing it to deliver a signal to its surroundings.

Nanoprocessors: Once the nanosensors detect the signals, they would transmit the data to the nanoprocessor,
which would be responsible for processing the signals and making decisions based on the data. The nanoprocessor
would be made up of transistors and logic gates made of nanomaterials such as silicon nanowires or carbon nanotubes.
